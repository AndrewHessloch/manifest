	This specification will define a <em>manifest</em>, which will provide
	developers with a centralized place to put metadata about a web
	application. This includes, amongst other things, the ability to
	specify the name of the web application, links to icons, as well as the
	preferred URL at which the web application should open when it is
	launched by the user.
      </p>
      <p>
	With this metadata, user agents will be able to provide, for example, enhanced
	bookmarking capabilities such as being able to add a web application to
	the homescreen of a device - as well as the various icons needed to
	effectively integrate with an OS's task switcher and system
	preferences. The specification also defines an API to enable
	bookmarking from within a document, as well as a means to check if an
	application is running in a special mode called "standalone".
      </p>
      <p>
	This specification might also define a declarative means for a web document to be associated
	with a manifest.
