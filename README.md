This repository is the home of the **Manifest** specification being worked on by 
the [Web Applications Working Group](http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/).

## Goals for v1

For the first version, we aim to standardize the following: 

* A link relationship for manifests (so they can be used with `<link>`).
* A standard file name for a manifest resource (i.e., manifest.json).  
* Launch URL.
* Application's name.
* Screen orientation hinting for when launching the app.
* Fullscreen at launch.
* Open in browser vs. open as "standalone".
* For standalone, enabling back-button and other UI (e.g., `minimal-ui`).
